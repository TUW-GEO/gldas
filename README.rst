Readers and converters for data from the `GLDAS Noah Land Surface Model
<http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/services/grads-gds/gldas>`_. Written in Python.

Works great in combination with `pytesmo <https://github.com/TUW-GEO/pytesmo>`_.

If you use the software in a publication then please cite it using the Zenodo DOI.
Be aware that this badge links to the latest package version.

Please select your specific version at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.596427 to get the DOI of that version.
You should normally always use the DOI for the specific version of your record in citations.
This is to ensure that other researchers can access the exact research artefact you used for reproducibility.

You can find additional information regarding DOI versioning at http://help.zenodo.org/#versioning

Installation
============

Setup of a complete environment with `conda
<http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_ can be performed using the following
commands:

.. code-block:: shell

  conda create -n gldas python=3.6 # or any other supported python version
  source activate gldas

.. code-block:: shell

  # Either install required conda packages manually
  conda install -c conda-forge numpy netCDF4 pyproj pygrib
  # Or use the provided environment file to install all dependencies
  conda env update -f environment.yml

.. code-block:: shell

  # Install the gldas package and pip-dependencies
  pip install gldas

This will also try to install pygrib for reading the GLDAS grib files. If this
does not work then please consult the `pygrib manual
<http://jswhit.github.io/pygrib/docs/>`_.

Supported Products
==================

At the moment this package supports GLDAS Noah data version 1 in grib
format (reading, time series creation) and GLDAS Noah data version 2.0 and version 2.1 in netCDF format (download, reading, time series creation) with a spatial sampling of 0.25 degrees.
It should be easy to extend the package to support other GLDAS based products.
This will be done as need arises.

Downloading Products
====================

In order to download GLDAS NOAH products you have to register an account with
NASA's Earthdata portal. Instructions can be found `here
<http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/registration/registration-for-data-access>`_.

After that you can use the command line program ``gldas_download``.

.. code::

   mkdir ~/workspace/gldas_data
   gldas_download ~/workspace/gldas_data

would download GLDAS Noah version 2.0 in 0.25 degree sampling into the folder
``~/workspace/gldas_data``. For more options run ``gldas_download -h``.

Contribute
==========

We are happy if you want to contribute. Please raise an issue explaining what is missing or if you find a bug. We will also gladly accept pull requests against our master branch for new features or bug fixes.

Development setup
-----------------

For Development we also recommend a ``conda`` environment. You can create one
including test dependencies and debugger by running
``conda env create -f environment.yml``. This will create a new ``gldas``
environment which you can activate by using ``source activate gldas``.

Guidelines
----------

If you want to contribute please follow these steps:

- Fork the gldas repository to your account
- Clone the repository, make sure you use ``git clone --recursive`` to also get the test data repository.
- make a new feature branch from the gldas master branch
- Add your feature
- Please include tests for your contributions in one of the test directories. We use py.test so a simple function called test_my_feature is enough
- submit a pull request to our master branch
